## üìä Output Format Examples

### Elevator Pitch (Example)
```
We propose Integrated Multi-Omic Profiling of Neuron-Derived Exosomes, 
Plasma Metabolomics, and Peripheral Immune Signatures for Early Detection 
of Alzheimer's Disease Pathology. This approach works by leveraging 
non-invasive blood-based biomarkers that reflect brain-specific changes 
5-10 years before clinical symptoms.
```

### Clinical Gap (Example)
```
Current AD diagnostics rely on cognitive tests and imaging, which detect 
changes only after significant neuronal damage, missing the critical 
pre-symptomatic window. This hypothesis addresses the unmet need for 
early detection by leveraging non-invasive blood-based biomarkers.
```

### Priority Actions (Example)
```
1. Validate key assumptions: Neuron-derived exosomes accurately reflect brain pathology
2. Test Amyloid-beta peptides as primary molecular target in disease model
3. Evaluate blood draw protocols for plasma/PBMC isolation
4. Validate cross-domain transfer from nanomedicine
5. Conduct systematic literature review to identify evidence gaps
6. Design preliminary in vitro/in vivo experiments to test mechanism
```

## üêõ Known Issues & Future Improvements

### Issues Identified (Non-Critical)

1. **Evidence Counting Bug**
   - **Issue**: "0 high-quality studies + 0 supporting sources" despite 29 sources
   - **Root Cause**: Tier counting logic in `_count_evidence_tiers()` may have threshold mismatch
   - **Impact**: Low (evidence is still used, just not displayed correctly in summary)
   - **Priority**: Medium

2. **Technical Feasibility 0%**
   - **Issue**: SimulationAgent shows 0% for technical_feasibility
   - **Root Cause**: Scorecard calculation bug in SimulationAgent
   - **Impact**: Medium (affects feasibility assessment accuracy)
   - **Priority**: Medium

3. **Text Truncation**
   - **Issue**: Some fields truncated at [:200] or [:300] characters
   - **Root Cause**: Conservative limits to prevent overwhelming output
   - **Impact**: Low (key info still visible)
   - **Priority**: Low

### Enhancements (Optional)

1. **Enrich All Agent Reasoning Steps**
   - Update remaining 6 agents to use `_get_domain_alternatives()`
   - Add more domain-specific biological reasoning
   - Priority: Low (current implementation functional)

2. **Counterfactuals**
   - Add "What if?" scenarios (e.g., "What if we used ptau-only approach?")
   - Enable sensitivity analysis
   - Priority: Low (future feature)

3. **Interactive Visualization**
   - Use `reasoning_narrative_json` to build interactive UI
   - Mermaid flowchart rendering
   - Expandable chips for Kept/Dropped decisions
   - Priority: Low (depends on frontend)

## üéì Key Learnings

### What Worked Well
1. **Layered Approach**: 3 output formats (executive/narrative/json) serve different needs
2. **Biological Focus**: Domain-specific reasoning > generic AI process description
3. **Structured JSON**: Enables programmatic access and UI flexibility
4. **Incremental Testing**: Small test scripts validated each phase

### What Was Challenging
1. **Balance**: Verbosity vs clarity (too much detail overwhelming, too little unhelpful)
2. **Evidence Integration**: Mapping 29 sources to actionable insights
3. **Cross-Agent Coherence**: Ensuring narrative flows logically across 7 agents
4. **Performance**: 6-minute generation time acceptable but could be optimized

### Best Practices Established
1. **Always validate imports** after code changes (datetime bug caught early)
2. **Test end-to-end** before claiming completion (test_nobel_phase2.py critical)
3. **Biological reasoning first** - medical researchers care about mechanism, not AI process
4. **Structured + unstructured** - JSON for machines, markdown for humans
